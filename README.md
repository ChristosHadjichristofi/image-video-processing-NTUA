# First Lab
At the theoretical part we read the article “The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code” by Burt, P. J. And Adelson, E. H. and described how the Laplacian Pyramid is used to compress an image. At the second part we used python to create functions that take a picture and compress it into a pyramid. We also created functions that decompress the previously created pyramid

# Second Lab
At the theoretical part we read the articles “An iterative image registration technique with an application to stereo vision” and “Pyramidal Implementation of the Affine Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker Description of the algorithm” and described the use of the Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker. At the second part we used a video from the VIRAT dataset to detect motion. At first we detected corners using Harris and Shi-Tomashi algorithms. Then we detected optical flow using Lucas-Kanade algorithm

# Third Lab
At the theoretical part we read the articles “Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network” by Y. Le Cun, B. Boser, J. S. Denker, D. Henderson, R. E. Howard, W. Hubbard and L. D. Jackel, “ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” by A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever and G. E. Hinton and “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition” by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman and described the structure of the LeNet, AlexNet and VGG convolutional networks. At the second part we used python to develop these networks as well as our own convolutional network which consisted of multiple convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers. Furthermore we juxtaposed the performance of these networks on the CIFAR100 data set. Finally, we used optimization and transfer learning techniques on our convolutional network to contend with overfitting.
